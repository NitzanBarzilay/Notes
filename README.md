# Notes
### What's in this repo?
Detailed notes of various Computer Science & Data Science courses - mostly courses form HebrewU buy also a variety of other courses I studied independently. The vast majority of these notes are in Hebrew - for HebrewU courses it's because that's the langueage the courses are tought in, and for other courses (such as CS224N) it's due to my goal to make data science / NLP more accesible to Hebrew speakers. 

Each note is available as a PDF file. Those files are filed into 3 filders for easy navigation, and their names contains the year they where written in.
